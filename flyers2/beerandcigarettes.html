	    - Missouri State Statute No. 407.925-407932</p>
	<p>&ldquo;An individual who begins drinking before age 15 is four times more likely to <br />
    	develop alcohol dependence than someone who waits until age 21 to use alcohol.&rdquo;<br />

	<p>&ldquo;Among 12 to 17 year-olds with no other problem behaviors, those who drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes at least once in the past month are 30 times more likely to smoke marijuana than those who did not.  These correlations are more pronounced for girls than boys.  Girls who drank and smoked were 36 times more likely to smoke marijuana and boys were 27 times more likely.&rdquo;<br />

	    - National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Columbia University, 1997</p>
