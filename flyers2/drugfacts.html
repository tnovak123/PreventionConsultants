<div id="Heading"><span class="MainTitle">Facts About Drugs</span>
	<br />
    <br />
	<span class="Description">The following is factual information about alcohol and other common drugs of abuse and addiction.</span>
</div>
<div id="Content">
	<p class="MainHeading">Alcohol (beer, wine, spirits, liquor)</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">This sedative is the most commonly abused drug by all ages.  It is a factor in the cause of illness, chronic diseases, car crashes, crime and accidents that often lead to death.</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">Symptoms:  slurred speech, loss of motor control, impulsiveness, strong odor of 	alcohol, loss of normal inhibitions, asleep and unable to awaken, unable to remember 	behavior from a previous day or evening, DWI arrests.</p>
	<p class="MainHeading">Marijuana (pot, grass, joint, weed)</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">This is the most widely used illicit drug in the United States.  It is derived from the tall, leafy, dark green plant (cannabis sativa) that is cultivated in many parts of the world and can also grow in the wild.  THC is the chemical in marijuana that creates the &ldquo;high&rdquo; when smoked.</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">Symptoms:  sleepiness, increased hunger, impaired short term memory, difficulty 	concentrating, increased heart rate, bloodshot eyes, decreased inhibitions, panic 	attacks, paranoia, strong burning odor (similar to burning leaves).</p>
	<p class="MainHeading">Methamphetamine (meth, ice, crank, glass)</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">This is a very addictive and increasingly produced and used substance (in both urban and rural Missouri) that effects the central nervous system as a very strong stimulant.  It is made with various chemicals and retail products in illegal &ldquo;labs&rdquo; (garages, storage sheds, kitchens).  When used, it is clear or discolored, and in a chunky, powder, or liquid form.  It can be taken orally, by snorting it through the nose, through injections, or it can be smoked.</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">Symptoms:  alertness, increased energy, suppressed appetite, feelings of well being, anxiety, impatience.  Long term effects are rapid weight loss, depleted energy 	reserves, insomnia, severe vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Overdose can cause delirium, panic, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, circulatory collapse, nausea, vomiting, seizures, coma and death.</p>
	<p class="MainHeading">Inhalants (glue, gas, paint, thinner, cleaning solvents, marking pens, correction fluid)</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">The use of inhalants poses a deadly threat.  The use of inhalants is attractive because the substances are easily obtained by those searching for a &ldquo;high&rdquo;.  Reports of first time user deaths are common.  Many of the chemicals are addictive.  Using inhalants is called &ldquo;huffing&rdquo;.  Users may use bags, soft drink cans or absorbent material to hold the inhaled substance.</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">Symptoms:  slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, dizziness, nausea, strong chemical 	odor, sores or rashes around the mouth and nose, confusion, loss of normal motor 	control.  Long term use can damage and destroy organs and tissues such as the brain, 	liver, kidneys, blood, and bone marrow.</p>
	<p class="MainHeading">Cocaine  (coke, crack, rock)</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">This highly addictive drug is derived from the leaves of the coca plant and has been used for centuries by snorting the powdered form.  Crack is a crystal form of cocaine and can be smoked or injected.  It produces a temporary euphoria followed by feelings of depression.  Many addicts report being &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; after their first use.</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">Symptoms:   euphoria, erratic behavior, increased blood pressure and heart rate, 	loss of concentration, memory problems, agitation, loss of money, loss of interest in 	family and friends, depression.  Strokes and heart attacks can be caused by its use.</p>
