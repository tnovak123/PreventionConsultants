  	<p class="ParagraphIndentItalicized">Available today, is a welcomed body of research about  raising children that supports much of what our parents already knew, but has  generated additional parenting guidelines for all parents and policy makers to  consider. The &ldquo;top 15&rdquo; list below is generated from the extensive research of  David Hawkins and Richard Catalano on risk and protective factors, as well as  the developmental asset findings of Peter Benson. The important findings of  these researchers have been instrumental in the creation of effective prevention  strategies for parents, schools, and communities.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Have clear, consistent, positive standards/expectations for your children&rsquo;s behavior.</li>
		<li>Help your children bond to your family, school and community.</li>
		<li>Involve your children meaningfully in the responsibilities and activities of the family.</li>
		<li>Praise, encourage, and pay attention to the behaviors and activities that your children do well.</li>
		<li>Model and help your child develop a strong belief in what is right and wrong.</li>
		<li>Allow your children to get involved in the activities of a church.</li>
		<li>Listen to your kids, support and affirm their thoughts and feelings, be willing and take time to have in-depth conversations on a regular basis, and provide advice when asked.</li>
		<li>Provide age-appropriate, consistent discipline when rules are broken.</li>
		<li>Always know where your children are going, with whom they will be, and decide by what time they will be home. (Away from home 3 or fewer nights a week for fun and recreation is recommended.)</li>
		<li>Help and encourage your children to succeed in school.</li>
		<li>Encourage and support your children&rsquo;s involvement in positive extracurricular activities.</li>
		<li>Encourage and support your children&rsquo;s involvement in positive activities in the community outside of school.</li>
		<li>Provide the opportunity for your children to develop positive relationships with non-parent adults.</li>
		<li>Support your children&rsquo;s relationships with peers who model responsible behavior.</li>
		<li>Provide your children with consistent, high levels of love and support.</li>
