    <span class="Description">Prevention Consultants of Missouri is your regional substance abuse prevention support center.</span> </div>
<div id="Content">
  <p class="MainHeading">Regional Substance Abuse Prevention Support Center</p>
  <p class="ParagraphIndent">As a Regional Support Center (RSC), volunteer prevention teams and coalitions, working to eliminate alcohol, tobacco and other substance abuse, are supported in eight south central Missouri counties. These services are provided through a contract with the Missouri Department of Mental Health, Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse. Over 220 community prevention coalitions currently exist as part of the Missouri Substance Abuse Prevention Network.</p>
  <p class="ParagraphIndent">The Missouri Prevention Network is based on the reality that those who work, go to school, raise a family, retire, and live each day in communities know best how to work toward their own effective solutions to identified, local problems.</p>
  <p class="ParagraphIndent">Communities concerned about substance abuse issues and motivated to bring about change are assisted by the RSC with community assessment, coalition organization, strategic planning, strategy development, prevention education, volunteer recruitment, identification of funding and other resources, implementation of prevention projects, program evaluation, and other technical assistance.</p>
  <p class="MainHeading">Counties Served by the RSC<br />

    Laclede Phelps Pulaski <br />
    St. Francois Washington</p>
  <p class="ParagraphIndent">Partnerships have been developed and maintained by the RSC with federal, state, and regional programs to support local prevention efforts. Often, coalitions are offered free or reduced cost training and program resources through these state and national prevention providers.</p>
  <p class="ParagraphIndent">At least once each year, established coalitions are given the opportunity to apply for a Missouri Prevention Assistance Grant to support their local efforts.</p>
  <p class="MainHeading">How to Start a Community Coalition</p>
  <p class="ParagraphIndent">There are common ingredients to effective prevention coalitions. If your community would like any level of support in building a coalition, the RSC is available to you. To be most effective, the group&rsquo;s members should include a broad representation of the community. This means involving parents, school personnel, law enforcement, church leaders, students, and others who represent different parts of the community. Whether a group is established or individuals are wanting to begin a new prevention coalition, contact the Support Center at Prevention Consultants of Missouri to learn what support and resources can help local prevention efforts.</p>
