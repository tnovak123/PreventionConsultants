<div id="Content">
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">Most of us look forward to the holiday season, but we also know it can be a hectic and sometimes stressful time. Cold weather, kids stuck in the house, spending more money, and not having time to get everything done are some of the biggest challenges during the holidays.</p>
	<p class="ParagraphIndent">Below are some ideas and suggestions on how to prevent the holidays from being overwhelming and bring back some of the peace and joy of this special time of year.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="Bold">Be organized as much as possible</span> - when there&rsquo;s a lot to do, having a plan usually makes it simpler and faster to get things done.</li>
		<li><span class="Bold">Be realistic</span> - it&rsquo;s okay if things are not perfect - if you expect to have the &ldquo;storybook&ldquo; holiday, you are setting yourself up for failure.</li>
		<li><span class="Bold">Recognize their excitement (&ldquo;you sure are excited&rdquo;) and accept it</span> - your kids will be excited nearly every waking moment during the holidays - it&rsquo;s all they will see and hear for about 4 weeks.</li>
		<li><span class="Bold">Plan special time for holiday traditions for your family</span> - give your kids something they can remember and continue with their families.</li>
		<li><span class="Bold">Ask for help when you need it, before you get stressed</span> - often, all that is needed to get help is being willing to ask.</li>
		<li><span class="Bold">Let others help when they ask if they can</span> - most people feel good when they have a chance to help</li>
		<li><span class="Bold">Remember that kids will remember most of the feelings they had during the holidays, not the gifts they receive</span> - affection, attention, support, being a good example, and love are the greatest gifts you can give your kids 365 days a year.</li>
