					<p class="ParagraphIndent">Our challenge as parents is to develop a habit of listening to both our children&rsquo;s words and actions to gain a better understanding of their thoughts, feelings and messages.</p>
					<p class="ParagraphIndent">To do this we can do two things. The first is to comment on the feelings they are displaying.  Such as, &ldquo;you look a little sad this afternoon&rdquo;, or &ldquo;wow you sure seem to be happy today&rdquo;, and then let them tell us about their experiences. The second thing we can do is quit trying to solve all their problems they discuss or judge their actions. Often, they just want you to listen...</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Be a responsible model for your children. They will do what you do. It is that simple.</li>
						<li>Set specific, firm and reasonable expectations, limits and rules that are consistently enforced.</li>
						<li>Know the facts about tobacco, alcohol and other drugs. Seek information if needed.</li>
						<li>Listen to your children with your eyes, ears and heart. A good listener is often all they want.</li>
						<li>Know your children&rsquo;s friends and get to know their parents. Share your concerns with them.</li>
						<li>Make your home a safe and drug free place for your children and their friends to gather.</li>
						<li>Know when and where your children are going and with whom they will be while there.</li>
						<li>Set enforced curfews for all nights of the week. Remember, not much good happens after midnight.</li>
						<li>Encourage involvement in positive youth activities at school, church and in the community.</li>
						<li>Everyday take time to let your children know how much you love them, support them, believe in them and expect the very best for them.</li>

				  <p align="center" class="MainHeading">If You Suspect Your Child May Be Using Alcohol or Other Drugs</p>
					<p class="ParagraphIndent">It is difficult to admit your child may be using alcohol and/or other drugs. Anger, isolation and guilt are common feelings in this situation. However, you must confront these feelings and get the help needed to immediately help your child.</p>
					<p class="ParagraphIndent">If under the influence of a substance, wait until the child is sober, then discuss your concern calmly and objectively. Next, impose discipline your family has decided for behavior that violates these rules and firmly stick to this. A firm message that this behavior is unacceptable is very important.</p>
					<p class="ParagraphIndent">If you believe your child is not being truthful about the extent of their use, you may have an experienced health professional  evaluate your child for alcohol and other drug problems. Your physician may even suggest drug testing if you are unsure of your child&rsquo;s use.</p>
					<p class="ParagraphIndent">If a pattern of use exists, you will likely need help to intervene. Your doctor, hospital, local mental health agency or school should be able to suggest referrals for appropriate services. The sooner your child receives help, the more likely  he or she will recover.</p>
