    <li>Be a good listener and avoid immediate labeling of their concerns as &ldquo;tattling&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>Think about other possible verbal or behavioral signs or signals your child has given you in the past that may be attributed to their being bullied.</li>
	<li>Ask for as many details regarding the bully behavior as possible. This should include when, where, how, who was involved, your child&rsquo;s verbal and behavioral response to the bully(ies), and witnesses.</li>
	<li>Discuss specific ideas how your child can prevent and respond to future bullying behavior. These include:
		<ul>
			<li>Ignore the bully, act as if their taunts do not bother you, walk away, stay away from the bully</li>
			<li>Tell the teacher, principal, counselor, and parents</li>
			<li>Stand up and speak up for yourself in a strong voice without acting scared or angry</li>
			<li>Try to make a friend of the bully – many bullies don’t have friends, or know how to make friends</li>
			<li>Talk to friends, ask friends to help stand up to the bully</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Know the school and school personnel with whom you can discuss the problem. Be willing to discuss your concerns with school personnel without blaming, making accusations, or threats. You will need their help to stop the bullying of your child at school.</li>
	<li>Be open to concerns that may be expressed by school personnel regarding your child&rsquo;s &ldquo;target behavior&rdquo;. These concerns will help you help your child better deal with bully behavior.</li>
	<li>Teach your child how to talk, walk, and sit straight, tall, and confident without showing fear.</li>
	<li>Help your child develop positive relationships with other children and youth groups.</li>
	<li>With your child and school personnel, develop a specific plan to deal with the bullying situation that determines what action will be taken by the target and school personnel if the bullying continues.</li>
